Since screens are now about twice as tall as they were, it only makes sense to have large titles. Another reason for large fonts is accessibility. With billions of people using their phone daily from all age groups, it is important to make the content as clear and readable as possible. Accessibility lets users set very large fonts for apps that support it. In iOS 11, all of Apple’s stock apps support that option.  Because of that reason, you’ll find that users are now expecting it."
